# Chat app

This is chat app where you can chat your friends or even with yourself :P. The chat app has functionality of chating with one or multiple users in direct messages and showing online users. It also persist messages upon disconnectivity so you don't lose any chat while you're away.

On server, I'm using socket.io and on frontend I'm using ReactJS.

## Server

To run server:

### `cd server`

### `npm install`

### `node index.js`

To run server:

### `cd client`

### `npm install`

### `npm run start`

NOTE: The server code was taken from the socket.io's tutorial website and then modified as per needs.
